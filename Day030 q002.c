/*You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 

Example 1:


Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,8,0,7]
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [8,0,7]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.*/

    while (l2) { s2[++t2] = l2->val; l2 = l2->next; }
    struct ListNode* head = NULL;
    int carry = 0;
    while (t1 >= 0 || t2 >= 0 || carry) {
        int sum = carry + (t1 >= 0 ? s1[t1--] : 0) + (t2 >= 0 ? s2[t2--] : 0);
        struct ListNode* node = (struct ListNode*)malloc(sizeof(struct ListNode));
        node->val = sum % 10;
        node->next = head;
        head = node;
        carry = sum / 10;
